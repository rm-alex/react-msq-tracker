# msq-tracker

This app was designed to aid in tracking a progress through the Final Fantasy XIV main scenario questline (MSQ).

Enter in a quest name at the top, and see how far along that quest is in the entire main story, or within a given section of the game!

Data is provided by Garland Tools through [garlandtools-api](https://github.com/karashiiro/garlandtools-api)

## TODO

Currently, the app begins at "It's Probably Pirates." The Gridania, Ul'Dah, and Limsa Lominsa starting questlines are not included.

These will be included in the future once I better figure out how to separate them given the data I have access to. 

Possibly requiring the player to select a starting city from a drop-down menu.
